1. run this in cmd: pip install pyinstaller

2. navigate to the directory the file is in (using cmd)

3. run: pyinstaller --onefile -w main.py
(can be any filename, in this case its named main.py)
4. it should say where the new exe is, all this does is makes it runnable without the dependancies needing to be installed
